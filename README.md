### Hello there 👋

I am Onur Ertunc, - a software engineer graduated from Bilkent University Department of Computer Engineering and currently doing my masters degree in Czech Technical University in Prague, at the Faculty of Information Technology, with the specialization of Computer Systems and Networks.

During my studies, I had the privilege of working part-time as a Software Engineer at BITES from July 2022 to June 2023. During this period, I was fortunate to be involved in an intriguing project focused on Digital Twins, a technology that replicates physical objects or processes in the digital realm in a mathematical manner rather than visual representations. This experience provided me with valuable opportunities to refine my skills, gain practical knowledge in software development, and contribute to an exciting project. Then, I joined to PoolText Inc as student engineer and become full time software engineer after my graduation.

You can also check my activities in GitLab, and LinkedIn via the links provided in my bio.
